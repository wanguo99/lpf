# PDM

PDM is the Peripheral Driver Module. It contains high-level peripheral services
built on top of LPF Core, PCONFIG, HAL, OSAL, and the PDM-owned internal
protocol helpers.

## Current Scope

The kernel module currently provides:

- module load/unload orchestration in `pdm/src/pdm.c`
- PCONFIG normalized-device query logic linked into `pdm.ko`
- PDM protocol package/parse helpers linked into `pdm.ko`; peripheral drivers
  pass a device type, message type, and payload to produce or parse standard
  protocol frames
- built-in peripheral-service registration through LPF Core
- configured-device binding and device removal ordering owned by LPF Core
- PDM MCU core, `/dev/pdm_mcu` ioctl dispatch, and CAN/Serial transport glue
  linked into `pdm.ko`
- PDM LED core and `/dev/pdm_led` ioctl dispatch for GPIO/PWM controlled LEDs
  linked into `pdm.ko`
- PDM control node `/dev/pdm_ctl` for LPF device discovery snapshots
- PDM procfs debug nodes under `/proc/pdm/`

PDM consumes exported `hal.ko` symbols for MCU transport and LED GPIO/PWM
hardware access.

## Layering

`pdm.ko` owns userspace boundaries per peripheral. Built-in PDM peripheral
services register as LPF drivers through LPF Core; during module initialization
PDM loads PConfig, maps each enabled normalized PConfig device entry into an
`lpf_device_config_t`, and registers it with LPF Core. PDM must not depend on
the concrete PCONFIG backend that produced the entries. LPF Core then binds the
configured device to the matching service `probe`. On unload, LPF Core removes
devices before driver global resources are released.

Each PDM peripheral exposes
its own character device, such as `/dev/pdm_mcu`, and each PDI peripheral API
uses the matching UAPI ioctl header, such as `pdi_mcu.h`.

`/dev/pdm_ctl` is the management node for discovery. It exposes LPF Core device
snapshots through `uapi/pdi/pdi_ctl.h`, including stable name, type, state,
driver name, and capability flags. It does not perform peripheral business
operations.

Procfs is reserved for debug and observability data. Current nodes:

- `/proc/pdm/mcu`
- `/proc/pdm/led`

Each node supports readback plus simple write commands for kernel-side
functional checks. Write commands return standard errno values and log command
results through the kernel log. For example:

- `echo "status 0" > /proc/pdm/mcu`
- `echo "cmd 0 0x10 0x01 0x02" > /proc/pdm/mcu`
- `echo "set 0 128" > /proc/pdm/led`
- `echo "enable 0" > /proc/pdm/led`

MCU transport APIs are linked into `pdm.ko`, but hardware access remains behind
HAL. `pdm.ko` depends on `lpf_core.ko` and `hal.ko`, and calls the HAL transport
symbols exported by `hal.ko`.

The protocol layer under `src/protocol/` is a common PDM-internal peripheral
communication protocol. It does not own module lifecycle; concrete peripheral
drivers such as MCU call it when they need framed communication.
